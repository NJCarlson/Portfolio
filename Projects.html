                        <li>I lead the development of the Unity plugin so other developers can easily add AI characters to their own games and apps.</li>
                        <li>I spend a lot of time in R&D figuring out how to make AI characters move and talk in a more human way.</li>

                    <p>Aquifer was built to let brands create animated content in minutes instead of weeks. I focused on making the technical side of animation simple for the people using the app.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I built the tools that allowed our artists to take famous characters like the Transformers or Paw Patrol and get them ready for the app.</li>
                        <li>I worked on the systems that helped the AI interpret facial expressions to keep the characters looking recognizable.</li>
                        <li>I helped set up the backbone of our asset pipeline to make sure we could push updates to users quickly and reliably.</li>

                    <p>
                      This pioneering initiative integrated advanced conversational AI into a premier educational platform, utilizing GPT-4 to create dynamic learning experiences. By enabling real-time dialogue with beloved animated characters, the project sought to transform passive screen time into an engaging, interactive tutoring session.

                    <ul>
                        <li>I was the lead engineer on this project from the first prototype all the way to the App Store launch.</li>
                        <li>I wrote the C# code that handles the conversation flow and keeps the AI responses safe and helpful.</li>
                        <li>I managed the multi-platform release to make sure the experience was identical on both iOS and Android.</li>

                    <h3>SIMETRI M3TS: AR Combat Medic Training</h3>
                    <p>This project used the Microsoft HoloLens 2 to train medics for high-pressure situations. It combines augmented reality with real physical equipment that you can actually hold and use.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I built the AR interface in Unity so that trainees could see medical data and targets while they worked.</li>
                        <li>I wrote the C++ code for the physical weapon controllers and sensors to make sure the hardware talked to the headset.</li>
                        <li>I designed a custom networking setup so all the gear stayed perfectly in sync over WiFi and Bluetooth.</li>
                        <li>Developed a hardware-in-the-loop integration for the SIMETRI Smart Tourniquet, requiring players to physically apply the device to halt hemorrhaging within the virtual simulation.</li>

                    <p>I helped develop a medical training tool that utilizes pressure sensors to monitor tourniquet application accuracy, streaming real-time performance data to a tablet for instructor evaluation.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed the sensor firmware to ensure high-speed, precision pressure data acquisition.</li>
                        <li>Built a custom bridge to interface the hardware with Unity, allowing the tourniquet to function as a physical controller for immersive simulations like the above M3TS project.</li>
                        <li>Performed hardware assembly and rigorous testing to ensure sensor accuracy and reliable data transmission across the system.</li>

                    <p>This is a hardware add-on for medical mannequins. It measures exactly how deep and how fast a student is doing chest compressions during CPR training.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was the lead developer for both the mobile app and the software running on the hardware itself.</li>
                        <li>I also handled the physical assembly, including soldering and testing for the initial 50 units we delivered to hospitals.</li>
                        <li>Managed on-site deployment for the initial 50 units, providing technical installation and hands-on training for hospital staff to ensure seamless integration into their curriculum.</li>
                        <li>Developed a high-concurrency Unity application that allows instructors to monitor real-time compression statistics for multiple mannequins simultaneously, enabling efficient proctoring for entire classes.</li>
                        <li>Integrated a post-session reporting system that generates detailed performance analytics, evaluating student consistency and adherence to life-saving CPR standards.</li>
