                    <p>Rapport allows users to have real-time conversations with digital characters. I work on the bridge between the AI brain and the visual body to make sure the performance feels natural and runs without lag.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I lead the development of the Unity plugin so other developers can easily add AI characters to their own games and apps.</li>
                        <li>I spend a lot of time in R&D figuring out how to make AI characters move and talk in a more human way.</li>
                        <li>I provide technical support for our largest clients to help them launch their projects globally.</li>

                    <p>Aquifer was built to let brands create animated content in minutes instead of weeks. I focused on making the technical side of animation simple for the people using the app.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I built the tools that allowed our artists to take famous characters like the Transformers or Paw Patrol and get them ready for the app.</li>
                        <li>I worked on the systems that helped the AI interpret facial expressions to keep the characters looking recognizable.</li>
                        <li>I set up the backbone of our asset pipeline to make sure we could push updates to users quickly and reliably.</li>

                    <h3>Ask ABC Mouse: AI for Kids</h3>
                    <p>This was one of the first major projects to safely put a conversational AI into a child’s educational app. It uses GPT-4 to help kids learn by talking to their favorite characters.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was the lead engineer on this project from the first prototype all the way to the App Store launch.</li>
                        <li>I wrote the C# code that handles the conversation flow and keeps the AI responses safe and helpful.</li>
                        <li>I managed the multi-platform release to make sure the experience was identical on both iOS and Android.</li>

                    <p>This project used the Microsoft HoloLens 2 to train medics for high-pressure situations. It combines augmented reality with real physical equipment that you can actually hold and use.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I built the AR interface in Unity so that trainees could see medical data and targets while they worked.</li>
                        <li>I wrote the C++ code for the physical weapon controllers and sensors to make sure the hardware talked to the headset.</li>
                        <li>I designed a custom networking setup so all the gear stayed perfectly in sync over WiFi and Bluetooth.</li>

                    <h3>SIMETRI Smart Tourniquet</h3>
                    <p>I helped create a medical trainer that uses pressure sensors to tell if a student is applying a tourniquet correctly. It sends that data to a tablet so a teacher can grade the performance.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I wrote the firmware for the sensors to get fast and accurate pressure readings.</li>
                        <li>I spent time in the lab testing the hardware to make sure it could survive thousands of uses in a training environment.</li>
