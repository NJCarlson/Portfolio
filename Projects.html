					<h3><a href="https://www.aquifermotion.com/" target="_blank">Aquifer Motion</a> </h3>
					<p>Instant animation ‍for brands and IP. Technology that makes storytelling simple for the world's
						biggest brands in film, TV, and entertainment.</p>
					<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
					<p>
						As a Senior Unity Engineer at Aquifer Motion, I focused on creating and implementing new
						systems, and debugging existing C# code. I created several in house tools that allowed artists
						to create and format custom assets!
						I especially loved collaborating with artists to fine tune the AI generation of facial
						animations for well known characters, like Care Bears and Baby Shark!
						I also helped organize all version control repositories, and maintain the asset pipeline.

						Age of Learning.</p>
					<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
					<p>
						While working at Aquifer Motion, I was put in charge of creating this new project from the
						ground up, while utilizing as much existing Aquifer technology as possible.
						I created most of the main C# systems, helped the artists implement assets and animations, and
						assisted with releasing the app to all mobile platforms.
						One exciting aspect of this project was working with OpenAI's GPT4 API!

							target="_blank">SIMETRI M3TS Care Under Fire Training </a> </h3>
					<p>SIMETRI has developed a virtual environment surrounding a wounded soldier while engaged in active
						combat with a virtual enemy combatant. In this environment,
						the trainee must apply a tourniquet and return enemy fire when the situation calls for it.
						Augmented Reality (AR) plays a role by
						overlaying a pool of blood underneath the soldier’s wounded leg. The trainee’s weapon, medical
						instruments,
						and the wounded soldier provide haptic cues to the trainee while the virtual environment
						overlaid onto the physical
						scene and simulated physiology are provided by the M3TS system.</p>

					<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
					<p>
						I got to have a ton of fun working with the Microsoft Hololens 2 Augmented reality headset in
						order to deliver the initial phase one prototype for this project!
						I collaborated with several artists to create the AR blood particle system, and a few mechanical
						engineers to build the weapon controller and training tourniquet.
						This prototype was built in Unity using c#, and I wrote the embedded C++ code for all
						controllers and training devices.
						I developed my own Wifi and BLE networking code to allow all controllers: the weapon,
						tourniquet, and manikin, to work with each other!

					<h3><a href="https://simetri.us/simetri-hosted-interactive-ar-haptic-training-tech-at-i-itsec/"
							target="_blank"> SIMETRI Interactive AR/Haptic Torniquet Training </a> </h3>
					<p>The Smart Tourniquet combines a realistic amputated limb physical simulator developed by the
						company’s special effects engineers and material scientists with a
						tablet-based mobile application that includes a visual display of the patient’s condition –
						replicating vital signs and monitoring tourniquet tension to ensure it
						has been properly tightened to reduce bleeding. </p>

					<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
					<p>
						I developed the embedded C++ code that sent tourniquet pressure data to the mobile application
						using Wifi!
						This was an exciting project, that required several revisions of testing and implementing
						different chips and sensors.

					<h3><a href="https://simetri.us/" target="_blank"> SIMETRI CPR Training </a> </h3>
					<p> SIMETRI created a module to assist health care professionals in the training and practice of
						CPR. This unit consisted of a box with a censor, connected to an app via Wifi.
						The application provides training instructors to see the compression depth and rate in real
						time.</p>

					<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
					<p>
						I was the lead developer on this project. I created the main application in Unity using C#, and
						the embedded software using C++.
						Not only did I write all the code for this project and implement all UI assets, I also soldered,
						flashed, and assembled all units!
						I immensely enjoyed traveling to local hospitals to deliver the finished project!

			<h2>Outside of work</h2>
		</header>
		<h4>Outside of work, I am an avid musician. When you can’t find me practicing guitar or drums, you’ll probably
			find me watching my favorite anime or movies.
			My favorite things to watch are older sci-fi flicks, like Blade Runner, The 5th Element, Big Trouble in
			Little China, Demolition Man, and Cowboy Bebop, just to name a few!
			As you can probably guess, I also love playing video games. Lately I’ve been playing Hearthstone, System
			Shock Remastered, Starfield, and War Hammer 40,000: Darktide!</h4>
