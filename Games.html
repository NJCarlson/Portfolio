							<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/682740/Data_Thief/" target="_blank">Data Thief - A VR Puzzle Game!</a> </h3>
							<p> Data Thief is a 3D VR puzzle game set in a technology-themed world where the player must solve a series of laser grid puzzles in order to steal priceless data. 
								The more high priority the hard drive, the harder it is to bypass security measures!</p>

								<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
								<p> This game was originally conceived as part of a final project in the Full Sail Game Development program. After graduating, myself and fellow classmates
									 continued development and released the game for free on Steam! Published under our own OttercopterStudios LLC.
									 I worked on the design and implementation of puzzles and interaction mechanics, as well as the majority of the UI. This project was built with Unity, using C#, for the HTC Vive.

							<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/786490/BrewHa/" target="_blank">Brewha! - A VR Action Game!</a> </h3>
							<p>Walk in the shoes of an alchemist for a medieval town. As a player fulfill orders of potions and throw them at the patrons for a high score in this VR game. 
								Beware the witch she’ll curse your customers and make everything more complicated! 
								Save the citizens of the town and become a master alchemist!</p>

								<h4> What I worked on: </h4>
								<p>As part of the Full Sail Game Design Master's program, I was the lead developer on Brewha, at Black Banshee Studios. 
									I worked with 2-3 other developers and artists to fulfil the designer's dreams. One of my favorite parts of this project was making the 
									witch fly around the room attacking patrons! I created and implemented all of the main game's main mechanics, including the mixing and throwing of potions.
									This project was created in Unity, using C# for the Oculus Rift.
